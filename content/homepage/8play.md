![Play on Tabletopia](images/tabletopia.png)

Coming soon: Buy a copy of BioInvaders! Raccoon Rampage

You can [play our game on Tabletopia](https://tabletopia.com/games/european-bioinvasions-raccoon-68a54u/play-now) or print and play it at home. Either way, it's completely free.  

Playing the game on Tabletopia should work on most computers and in most web browsers. We find it works best in Chrome. It's hard to play with a trackpad so try to find a mouse if you can.

The online version doesn't automatically implement the rules of the game, so you'll need to learn and run the game yourself.

You can download the rulebook [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/14Nng7MsOQp2H0pkIXKGODv16xZxWK8lO/view?usp=sharing) and watch a video explanation below.

If you have any feedback or questions about the rules we'd love to hear that feedback.

If you would like to print and play the game at home, you can!

You'll need to find some cubes and dice and some stickers to customise one die.

You can download PDFs of all of the game materials [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-oQcKtX3N1mbaKjmIIQhNDENguV8Dkb6/view?usp=sharing).
