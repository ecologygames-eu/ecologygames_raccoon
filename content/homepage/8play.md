Coming soon: Buy a copy of BioInvaders! Raccoon Rampage

You can also [play our game on Tabletopia](https://tabletopia.com/games/european-bioinvasions-raccoon-68a54u/play-now), it's completely free.  

Playing the game on Tabletopia should work on most computers and in most web browsers. We find it works best in Chrome. It's hard to play with a trackpad so try to find a mouse if you can.

The online version doesn't automatically implement the rules of the game, so you'll need to learn and run the game yourself.

You can download the rulebook [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/14Nng7MsOQp2H0pkIXKGODv16xZxWK8lO/view?usp=sharing) and watch a video explanation below.

If you have any feedback or questions about the rules we'd love to hear that feedback.
