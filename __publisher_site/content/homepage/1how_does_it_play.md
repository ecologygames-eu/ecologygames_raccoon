That is the important part, right? You want to know what I can do for you. This is why I put this right up there into the header menu of the website.

The game features a mix of strategic planning and social negotiation.  Players pick policies to put into a queue, vote on policies *in* the queue, and dabble in chaos using action cards that manipulate things in their favour.  

What's unique about the experience is the mix of playing as a team as well as fighting to win solo.

Like Pandemic, players are working together to stop the spread of a (raccoon) invasion.  But, unlike Pandemic, players individually want to win.  This means a lot of backstabbing that can lead to everyone failing, but if you play too nice... you're not going to win!

Key features:
* ages 12+
* 3 or 4 players
* 45 - 60 mins
* over 160 beautiful cards
* four storylines (that can be mashed up)
* a large game board
* four unique player roles each with their own unique decks and player boards


## Four player decks made of policy and action cards


Players have a mix of **policy** and **action** cards.  On their turn, players put policy cards into a queue that each player can vote on.  If a card gets enough votes, we move towards victory as a group but of course, each player wants *their* policies to win.

Each deck has a mix of standard and unique policy cards (black border).

Action cards let players *mess* with each other.  Whether it's stealing votes, swapping policies or manipulating the results of a vote, strategic decisions on when to play these powerful cards is crucial for success.

Each deck also has a mix of standard and unique action cards (white border).


## Four storylines that can be mashed up for variations

Every round a new story card is flipped.  These story cards put pressure on players to work together and put their personal goals in conflict with the group mission.  Every vote counts - do we act on the story event for immediate benefit? Or do we instead invest in longer term goals?
