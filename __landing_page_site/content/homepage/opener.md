Raccoon Rampage is a fast paced game of negotiation and strategy for 3 to 4 players.  Play as hunters, animal rights activists or as an entire country as you try to stop Raccoons from invading Europe and messing up all our stuff!

Perfect for family game nights or for classroom environments, in this semi-cooperative game players have to work as a team to save Europe from invading Raccoons while figuring out how to one-up their opponents.

Featuring over 160 stunning cards, a huge game mat, as well as four unique player boards this game is as much fun to look at as it is to play.

But don't take our word for it:
